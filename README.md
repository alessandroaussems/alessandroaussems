### Hi there! :wave:
I'am Alessandro, web developer :sunglasses: based in [Lier, Belgium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/2500+Lier/@51.1193298,4.5392708,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c3fc63b318c329:0x6ae7fc52ac33a641!8m2!3d51.1302138!4d4.5715093).

My expertise is PHP development more specifically: [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) & [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), however I'am not shy of frontend, I also love working with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) & Sass

To stay in the zone I love listening to music :musical_note:. My most played songs are also often played at the mainstage of a well known [festival](https://www.tomorrowland.com/global/) in Boom, Belgium :raised_hands:

When I am not behind my computer I love to do some sports: cycling, running, fitness, football you name it! :muscle:

Cheers :punch:
