### Hi there! :wave:
I'am Alessandro, web developer :sunglasses: based in Lier, Belgium.

My expertise is PHP development more specifically: Drupal & Laravel, however I'am not shy of frontend, I also love working with Vue.js & Sass

To stay in the zone I love listening to music :musical_note:. My most played songs are also often played at the mainstage of a well known festival in Boom, Belgium :raised_hands:

When I am not behind my computer I love to do some sports: cycling, running, fitness, football you name it! :muscle:

Cheers :punch:
